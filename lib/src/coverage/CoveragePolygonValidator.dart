/**
 * Validates that a polygon forms a valid polygonal coverage 
 * with the set of polygons adjacent to it.  
 * If the polygon is coverage-valid an empty {@link LineString} is returned.
 * Otherwise, the result is a linear geometry containing 
 * the target polygon boundary linework causing the invalidity.
 * <p>
 * A polygon is coverage-valid if:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The polygon interior does not intersect the interior of other polygons.
 * <li>If the polygon boundary intersects another polygon boundary, the vertices
 * and line segments of the intersection match exactly.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * The algorithm detects the following coverage errors:
 * <ol>
 * <li>the polygon is a duplicate of another one
 * <li>a polygon boundary segment equals an adjacent segment (with same orientation).
 *     This determines that the polygons overlap 
 * <li>a polygon boundary segment is collinear and overlaps an adjacent segment 
 *     but is not equal to it
 * <li>a polygon boundary segment touches an adjacent segment at a non-vertex point
 * <li>a polygon boundary segment crosses into an adjacent polygon
 * <li>a polygon boundary segment is in the interior of an adjacent polygon 
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * If any of these errors is present, the target polygon
 * does not form a valid coverage with the adjacent polygons.
 * <p>
 * The validity rules do not preclude properly-noded gaps between coverage polygons.
 * However, this class can detect narrow gaps, 
 * by specifying a maximum gap width using {@link #setGapWidth(double)}.
 * Note that this will also identify narrow gaps separating disjoint coverage regions, 
 * and narrow gores.
 * In some situations it may also produce false positives 
 * (i.e. linework identified as part of a gap which is wider than the given width).
 * To fully identify gaps it maybe necessary to use {@link CoverageUnion} and analyze
 * the holes in the result to see if they are acceptable.
 * <p>
 * A polygon may be coverage-valid with respect to 
 * a set of surrounding polygons, but the collection as a whole may not
 * form a clean coverage.  For example, the target polygon boundary may be fully matched
 * by adjacent boundary segments, but the adjacent set contains polygons 
 * which are not coverage-valid relative to other ones in the set.
 * A coverage is valid only if every polygon in the coverage is coverage-valid.
 * Use {@link CoverageValidator} to validate an entire set of polygons.
 * <p>
 * The adjacent set may contain polygons which do not intersect the target polygon.
 * These are effectively ignored during validation (but may decrease performance).
